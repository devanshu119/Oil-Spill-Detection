contrast enhancement, and normalization.

    Apply a Lee filter for speckle noise reduction.
    The Lee filter is an adaptive filter that preserves edges while smoothing noise.

        np.ndarray: The filtered image.

    Main function to execute the full preprocessing pipeline on a single SAR image.
    
    Pipeline steps:
    1. Load the image and convert to grayscale float.
    2. Apply the Lee filter to reduce speckle noise.
    3. Enhance contrast using histogram equalization.
    4. Resize the image to the model's expected input dimensions.
    5. Normalize pixel values to the  range.
    6. Expand dimensions to create a batch of 1 for model input.
    
    Args:
        input_path (str): The file path to the input SAR image.
        target_size (tuple): The target (height, width) for the model input.
        
    Returns:
        np.ndarray: The preprocessed image tensor of shape (1, H, W, 1).
